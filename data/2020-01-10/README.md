# Data of 2020-01-10

The data is still based on the results gathered during my Master's thesis.
However, in the F185 and F275 sets, the divisors of the relative features are
increased by an espilon (1e-7) to ensure non-zero division. Due to a design
flaw, the epsilon was also added to some dividends as well, resulting certain
unused features having the value 1e-7 instead of 0.

In this iteration of the data, this is fixed.
